# AI Image Remastering

# Project Summary:

The AI Image Remastering project aims to develop an image enhancement pipeline using deep learning techniques to transform low-resolution images into high-resolution ones with improved visual quality. In today's digital era, the demand for high-quality images is increasing across various domains such as medical imaging, satellite imaging, and photography. However, obtaining high-resolution images can be challenging due to hardware limitations or environmental conditions.

# Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to leverage state-of-the-art deep learning models to enhance the resolution of low-quality images. By utilizing pre-trained models like SRGAN, ESRGAN, Real-ESRGAN, and GFPGAN, we aim to achieve significant improvements in image quality, making low-resolution images visually comparable to high-resolution ones.

# Key Features:

Dataset Preparation: Acquiring and preprocessing a comprehensive dataset of high-resolution images.
Model Development: Developing and training deep learning models to enhance image resolution.
Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics such as PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index).
Deployment: Creating a user-friendly web application using Flask or Streamlit for image enhancement.
Mobile App Development: Optionally, creating a mobile app APK to enable image enhancement on mobile devices.
